          <i> Dogs are intelligent and friendly animals. There are different origins of dogs, but all <br> 
            of them are short, small, heavy, without hair has good heart and faithful spirits. </i> <br>

        <i> The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is a domesticated <br>
         canid which has been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory <br>
         capabilities, and physical attributes.[2] <br>
             Although initially thought to have originated as a manmade variant of an extant<br>
         canid species (variously supposed as being the dhole,[3] golden jackal,[4] or gray<br>
         wolf[5]), extensive genetic studies undertaken during the 2010s indicate that dogs<br>
         diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in Eurasia 40,000 years ago.[6] Being the<br>
         oldest domesticated animal, their long association with people has allowed dogs to<br>
         be uniquely attuned to human behavior,[7] as well as thrive on a starch-rich diet <br>
         which would be inadequate for other canid species.[8]<br>
            Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads,<br> 
         protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding<br>
         handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname <br>
         "man's best friend" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are a source<br> 
         of meat.[9][10] </i> <br>
