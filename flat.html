        <p id="info">
        <i>Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic marine mammals.
          They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so
          to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families
          Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins),
          Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). 
          There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong
          to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives
          are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.</h3>
